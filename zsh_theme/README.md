&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you dont, well get it from [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), its awesome :p

### How to apply themes

#### 1. Open up a terminal and type the following command
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zlash65/random/master/zsh_theme/zlash.zsh-theme
```
#### 2. Type the following command
```
mv zlash.zsh-theme .oh-my-zsh/themes
```
#### 3. Now that everything's placed correctly, here's how to apply it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the following command
```
gedit ./.zshrc
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next look for the line **ZSH_THEME='something'** and change it to **ZSH_THEME='zlash'**

#### 4. Close the terminal and open it once again. There it is, the theme being applied!
